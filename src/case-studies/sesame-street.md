  heading: Methodology
  description: Next&Co implemented an audience-first pilot campaign and tested different creative messaging across search, social, video and display to see which audiences would resonate with which message. Once the highest converting audience/message segments were identified budget splits across each channel were flighted accordingly to achieve the ticket sales KPI set by the client. Performance and budget shifting occurred on a daily basis to ensure the correct audience had the optimal amount of spend to increase ticket sales
